			<content>1 2 3 Dissimulation is but a faint kind of policy  or wisdom  for it asketh a strong wit  and a strong heart  to know when to tell truth  and to do it. Therefore it is the weaker sort of politics  that are the great dissemblers. Tacitus saith  Livia sorted well with the arts of her husband  and dissimulation of her son  attributing arts or policy to Augustus  and dissimulation to Tiberius. And again  when Mucianus encourageth Vespasian  to take arms against Vitellius  he saith  We rise not against the piercing judgment of Augustus  nor the extreme caution or closeness of Tiberius. These properties  of arts or policy  and dissimulation or closeness  are indeed habits and faculties several  and to be distinguished. For if a man have that penetration of judgment  as he can discern what things are to be laid open  and what to be secreted  and what to be showed at half lights  and to whom and when  which indeed are arts of state  and arts of life  as Tacitus well calleth them   to him  a habit of dissimulation is a hinderance and a poorness. But if a man cannot obtain to that judgment  then it is left to him generally  to be close  and a dissembler. For where a man cannot choose  or vary in particulars  there it is good to take the safest  and wariest way  in general  like the going softly  by one that cannot well see. Certainly the ablest men that ever were  have had all an openness  and frankness  of dealing  and a name of certainty and veracity  but then they were like horses well managed  for they could tell passing well  when to stop or turn  and at such times  when they thought the case indeed required dissimulation  if then they used it  it came to pass that the former opinion  spread abroad  of their good faith and clearness of dealing  made them almost invisible.  There be three degrees of this hiding and veiling of a man s self. The first  closeness  reservation  and secrecy  when a man leaveth himself without observation  or without hold to be taken  what he is. The second  dissimulation  in the negative  when a man lets fall signs and arguments  that he is not  that he is. And the third  simulation  in the affirmative  when a man industriously and expressly feigns and pretends to be  that he is not.  For the first of these  secrecy  it is indeed the virtue of a confessor. And assuredly  the secret man heareth many confessions. For who will open himself  to a blab or a babbler  But if a man be thought secret  it inviteth discovery  as the more close air sucketh in the more open  and as in confession  the revealing is not for worldly use  but for the ease of a man s heart  so secret men come to the knowledge of many things in that kind  while men rather discharge their minds  than impart their minds. In few words  mysteries are due to secrecy. Besides  to say truth  nakedness is uncomely  as well in mind as body  and it addeth no small reverence  to men s manners and actions  if they be not altogether open. As for talkers and futile persons  they are commonly vain and credulous withal. For he that talketh what he knoweth  will also talk what he knoweth not. Therefore set it down  that an habit of secrecy  is both politic and moral. And in this part  it is good that a man s face give his tongue leave to speak. For the discovery of a man s self  by the tracts of his countenance  is a great weakness and betraying  by how much it is many times more marked  and believed  than a man s words.  For the second  which is dissimulation  it followeth many times upon secrecy  by a necessity  so that he that will be secret  must be a dissembler in some degree. For men are too cunning  to suffer a man to keep an indifferent carriage between both  and to be secret  without swaying the balance on either side. They will so beset a man with questions  and draw him on  and pick it out of him  that  without an absurd silence  he must show an inclination one way  or if he do not  they will gather as much by his silence  as by his speech. As for equivocations  or oraculous speeches  they cannot hold out long. So that no man can be secret  except he give himself a little scope of dissimulation  which is  as it were  but the skirts or train of secrecy.  But for the third degree  which is simulation  and false profession  that I hold more culpable  and less politic  except it be in great and rare matters. And therefore a general custom of simulation  which is this last degree  is a vice  rising either of a natural falseness or fearfulness  or of a mind that hath some main faults  which because a man must needs disguise  it maketh him practise simulation in other things  lest his hand should be out of use.  The great advantages of simulation and dissimulation are three. First  to lay asleep opposition  and to surprise. For where a man s intentions are published  it is an alarum  to call up all that are against them. The second is  to reserve to a man s self a fair retreat. For if a man engage himself by a manifest declaration  he must go through or take a fall. The third is  the better to discover the mind of another. For to him that opens himself  men will hardly show themselves adverse  but will fair let him go on  and turn their freedom of speech  to freedom of thought. And therefore it is a good shrewd proverb of the Spaniard  Tell a lie and find a troth. As if there were no way of discovery  but by simulation. There be also three disadvantages  to set it even. The first  that simulation and dissimulation commonly carry with them a show of fearfulness  which in any business  doth spoil the feathers  of round flying up to the mark. The second  that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits of many  that perhaps would otherwise co operate with him  and makes a man walk almost alone  to his own ends. The third and greatest is  that it depriveth a man of one of the most principal instruments for action  which is trust and belief. The best composition and temperature  is to have openness in fame and opinion  secrecy in habit  dissimulation in seasonable use  and a power to feign  if there be no remedy. </content></resource>

<content> We will speak of nobility  first as a portion of an estate  then as a condition of particular persons. A monarchy  where there is no nobility at all  is ever a pure and absolute tyranny  as that of the Turks. For nobility attempers sovereignty  and draws the eyes of the people  somewhat aside from the line royal. But for democracies  they need it not  and they are commonly more quiet  and less subject to sedition  than where there are stirps of nobles. For men s eyes are upon the business  and not upon the persons  or if upon the persons  it is for the business  sake  as fittest  and not for flags and pedigree. We see the Switzers last well  notwithstanding their diversity of religion  and of cantons. For utility is their bond  and not respects. The united provinces of the Low Countries  in their government  excel  for where there is an equality  the consultations are more indifferent  and the payments and tributes  more cheerful. A great and potent nobility  addeth majesty to a monarch  but diminisheth power  and putteth life and spirit into the people  but presseth their fortune. It is well  when nobles are not too great for sovereignty nor for justice  and yet maintained in that height  as the insolency of inferiors may be broken upon them  before it come on too fast upon the majesty of kings. A numerous nobility causeth poverty  and inconvenience in a state  for it is a surcharge of expense  and besides  it being of necessity  that many of the nobility fall  in time  to be weak in fortune  it maketh a kind of disproportion  between honor and means. As for nobility in particular persons  it is a reverend thing  to see an ancient castle or building  not in decay  or to see a fair timber tree  sound and perfect. How much more  to behold an ancient noble family  which has stood against the waves and weathers of time  For new nobility is but the act of power  but ancient nobility is the act of time. Those that are first raised to nobility  are commonly more virtuous  but less innocent  than their descendants  for there is rarely any rising  but by a commixture of good and evil arts. But it is reason  the memory of their virtues remain to their posterity  and their faults die with themselves. Nobility of birth commonly abateth industry  and he that is not industrious  envieth him that is. Besides  noble persons cannot go much higher  and he that standeth at a stay  when others rise  can hardly avoid motions of envy. On the other side  nobility extinguisheth the passive envy from others  towards them  because they are in possession of honor. Certainly  kings that have able men of their nobility  shall find ease in employing them  and a better slide into their business  for people naturally bend to them  as born in some sort to command.</content></resource>
